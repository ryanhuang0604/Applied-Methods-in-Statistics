**Problem 1**

**(a)**
```{r}
status <- c("Admit", "Deny")
gender <- c("Male", "Female")
data <- c(490, 210, 280, 220)
table <- expand.grid(status=status, gender=gender)
table <- cbind(table, count=data)
result <- xtabs(count ~ gender+status, table)
addmargins(result)
```


**(b)**
```{r}
prop.table(result, 1)
```
The percentage of male applicants who are admitted $= \frac{490}{700} = 70\%$.\newline
The percentage of female applicants who are admitted $= \frac{280}{500} = 56\%$.\newline\newline


**(c)**
```{r}
business <- c(480, 120, 180, 20)
table1 <- expand.grid(status=status, gender=gender)
table1 <- cbind(table1, count=business)
result1 <- xtabs(count ~ gender+status, table1)
prop.table(result1, 1)
```
In business school, the percentage of male applicants admitted $= \frac{480}{600} = 80\%$; the percentage of female applicants admitted $= \frac{180}{200} = 90\%$.\newline

```{r}
law <- c(10, 90, 100, 200)
table2 <- expand.grid(status=status, gender=gender)
table2 <- cbind(table2, count=law)
result2 <- xtabs(count ~ gender+status, table2)
prop.table(result2, 1)
```
In law school, the percentage of male applicants admitted $= \frac{10}{100} = 10\%$; the percentage of female applicants admitted $= \frac{100}{300} = 33.33\%$.\newline\newline


**(d)**\newline
The percentage of admitted business school is $\frac{660}{770} = 85.7\%$, while that of admitted law school is $\frac{110}{770} = 14.3\%$. Thus, we could see that the percentage of getting admission from business school is higher than from law school. In addition, $\frac{600}{700} = 85.7\%$ of male applicants applied for business school, while $\frac{300}{500} = 60\%$ of female applicants applied for law school. As a result, we could see that since women tended to apply to school with low admission rate, the overall result will show that men are easier to get admission.\newline\newline


**Problem 2**

**(a)**
```{r}
program <- c("Accounting", "Administration", "Economics", "Finance")
gender <- c("Female", "Male")
data <- c(68, 91, 5, 61, 56, 40, 6, 59)
table <- expand.grid(program=program, gender=gender)
table <- cbind(table, count=data)
result <- xtabs(count ~ program+gender, table)
chi <- chisq.test(result)
chi
```
Since $\text{p-value} = 0.0127 < 0.05$, we could conclude that there is relationship between the gender of students and their choice of major.\newline\newline


**(b)**
```{r}
expected <- chi$expected
sum((data-expected)^2 / expected)
```
$\text{Chi-square} = 10.82673$ is equal to the above result.\newline\newline


**(c)**
```{r}
prop.table(result, 2)
```
![Caption for the picture.](D:\Ryan\Ryan\5交通大學\課程\一下\03統計應用方法\作業\HW4\img.png)
\newline
In both accounting and economics, the percentage of male and female is almost the same (the difference is less than 5%). While in other two majors, women have higher percentage choosing administration and men have higher percentage choosing finance.\newline\newline


**(d)**
```{r}
observed <- chi$observed
expected <- chi$expected
data <- c((observed-expected)^2 / expected)
table <- expand.grid(program=program, gender=gender)
table <- cbind(table, count=data)
result <- xtabs(count ~ program+gender, table)
```
```{r}
observed
expected
result
```
Cells of "female majors in administration" and "male majors in administration" have the largest terms of chi-square statistic. In these cells, the difference between their observed value and expected value is much more bigger than others.\newline\newline


**(e)**
```{r}
1 - sum(observed) / 722
```
There is about $46.54\%$ of the students did not respond to the questionnaire.\newline\newline


**Problem 3**

**(a)**
```{r}
TA <- c(0.32, 0.41, 0.2, 0.07)
professor <- c(22, 38, 20, 11)

professor / sum(professor)
```
The distribution of grade taught by professor is (0.24, 0.42, 0.22, 0.12) (corresponding to grade (A, B, C, D/F)), which is different from (0.32, 0.41, 0.2, 0.07). The ratio of grade A given by professor is less than that given by TA, while the ratio of grade D/F given by professor is more than that given by TA.\newline\newline


**(b)**
```{r}
TA * sum(professor)
```
The expected counts of each grade in professor's section should be (29, 37, 18, 6). \newline\newline


**(c)**
```{r}
grade <- c(22, 38, 20, 11)
expected <- c(rep(sum(grade)/4, 4))
chi_square <- sum((grade-expected)^2 / expected)
```
```{r}
chi_square
pchisq(chi_square, df=3)
1 - pchisq(chi_square, df=3)
```
Since $\text{chi-square} = 16.64835 > 0.9991653$ and $\text{p-value} = 0.0008347256 < 0.05$, we could conclude that not all the probability of grade is equal to $\frac{1}{4}$, that is, the professor follows a different grade distribution.
